The S&P 500 gained 1.2% after CPI came in slightly below expectations, sparking renewed optimism about a potential Fed rate cut. Nasdaq led the rally thanks to strong tech earnings, especially from Nvidia and Microsoft. Bond yields fell as investors shifted into equities. Crude oil dipped on concerns of slowing global demand. All eyes are now on Friday's jobs report for confirmation of economic softening.\n\nInvestor sentiment is improving but still cautious. Safe-haven assets like gold held steady while volatility indices dropped. Analysts are watching whether these bullish moves hold if upcoming employment data disappoints.",
